# Python Course for Beginners

Learn Python from the very beginning.
We will start from the very bottom (installation, how to work with Python,...) and then slowly work our way to more complicated concepts.

## Prerequirements

+ actually nothing but a working computer with an installed IDE

## Structure

Each unit deals with new topics, some of those build on each other or are interrelated.

We will explain basic concepts of each topic, so that you can work on the subsequent tasks.
Because after all, what's the best way to learn how to program?
Alright, by programming!

That's why the course should be as interactive as possible.

Don't hesitate to ask questions or try things out. There is no better teacher than error messages.
